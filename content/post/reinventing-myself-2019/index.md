<br/>
The end of 2019 is right near the corner, and I thought it would be the right time for me to reflect over my professional progress over the last year.
<br/>
<br/>
### **New Job**

The first major change for me in 2019 was starting a new job.
<br/>In December 2018, after I've left my previous job after working for more than 4 years as a Ruby developer on a social platform,
I was looking for a position that will enforce me to get out of my comfort zone and push me to my limits.
<br/>

Somewhere at 2015, I've read about a relatively new programming-language called Rust developed in Mozilla.
From a first glance, the syntax was a bit awkward and I've chosen not to pursue with researching it.

It wasn't until 2018 that it finally struck me that Rust is not just another new trendy programming-language, but something different, disruptive that must be learned.
I finally understood what the hype was all about. And I really wanted to work with this programming-language sometime.

When I was searching a now job, I really wanted that position to involve programming in Rust to some extent.
Rust has been (and still is) in its early-adopters stage, so there weren't not many vacancies, let alone in Israel which is a small country.
Therefore, I've started looking for a Rust remote position.

Unsurprisingly, there were scarcely remote options, but luckily I've stumbled upon a small remote jobs website that had an open position in NYC.
The name of the company was [spacemesh][spacemesh], where I'm working now. The funny thing is that spacemesh is an Israeli company that looked for people outside of Israel too.
spacemesh is about TBD

Besides only knowing the very basics of Rust and having no hands-on Rust experience, this position was about developing Smart-Contracts infrastructure.
Meaning, having some compilation knowledge was also required. I did a Compilers course more than 10 years ago when I was a student, but otherwise didn't have any knowledge whatsoever.
Actually, I had no knowledge about Blockchain or Smart-Contracts either.

Obviously, this position seemed like one that will require me to go out of my comfort zone.
In many terms it forced me to do a substantial start over, and that was perfect for me.
Luckily, I got the chance and got this position!

I was ready to embark on this new journey, with much excitement and some fears how things will turn.

### **Rust**
So 2019 was the year I started working as a Rust programmer. Rust is known for having a steep learning curve but in the end of the day, I truly think it does worth it.

What I really liked about Rust was that on one hand Rust is a system programming-language, so it's inclined to serve as an alternative to languages such as C and C++.
But on the other hand Rust, has has many high-level abstractions that are usually found at more high-level programming-languages running within a full-fledged runtime.

Rust has a lot of functional syntax, support futures, meta-programming, traits, and more.

So Rust is a very versatile language. You can virtually build with it anything. Not only low-level programs
(operating-systems, compilers, databases, games-engines, text-editors etc), but also Web applications, command-line utilities or any script that would otherwise be coded
in python/ruby/shell script.

The other game-changer of Rust is safety. Rust unique ownership model accompanied with awesome compilation error messages brings a lot of confidence to the developer.
It's way more than just develop happiness. It's developer confidence.

A lot of the pain is taken care of thanks to the Rust compiler.
Many safety (memory-leaks, bad memory access, race-conditions) pitfalls get caught in compilation time.

These days Rust is heavily used in Blockchain projects. New databases are being written in it. Games companies start using it and many deep-tech companies
use Rust as part of their tech-stack.

Not only that, but whale companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dropbox and more are betting on Rust. It's seems like a new era.
I think that the turning point for many Rust users is that historically TBD
<br/>
<br/>
### **Compilation**
As part of my job, I've immersed myself in the fascinating world of compilers in general and specifically WebAssembly.
I still have a long way to go, but I did manage to build a very basic programming-language that runs in interpreted mode.
Here is a link to the repository.

In the last months of this year I've reached the first milestone of SVM - the runtime based on wasmer that spacemesh will execute in the future
its Smart-Contracts. More on SVM can be read here TBD

As a bonus, I've made some small contributions to wasmer.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Relearning to type**
I've written about my learning to type in Colemak in this post. Apart from the obvious productivity boost of using a more ergonomic keyboard-layout, there is the mental side
of muscle memory rewiring. Taking this challenge was not easy but very rewarding. I'd recommend anyone to try out sometime to try this or something else similar
that will make them relearn a daily activity that he/she is doing in an autopilot mode.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Reading code**
I've always loved reading beautiful pieces of code. Learning how other people think, how they approach a given problem.

Observing elegant abstractions that simplify problems that seem intractable is a real joy.
This year I've read a lot of Open-Source code. This is undoubtedly something I'd like to continue doing and at greater scale in the future.

Learning from others is a super important for getting better. [Here's a very nice recommend article][ultralearning-environments]
<br/>
<br/>
### **Working on my English**
This year I've worked hard on my English vocabulary, hoping that having a richer dictionary will give me a boost while working.
In the last 6 months I practiced daily [Supermemo][supermemo] (see also: [Spaced Repetition][spaced-repetition]).
At first glance, it might not seem that important, but I think that being articulate is a key requirement that anyone should aim to possess.

First of all, a considerable amount of development-time is about communicating what we did/doing/will be doing.
We write emails, Slack with other people, write comments on PRs and of course we **document our code**.

Being able to deliver you message is critical. Secondly, there's a well known quote saying:

_There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things_
<br/>
_- Phil Karlton_

Naming things right is crucial to writing good code.
<br/>Good code should be explicit and express its intent clearly.
<br/><br/>Without good names for functions/classes/modules/variables the readability of the code will suffer.
Having a richer vocabulary makes the task for naming much more effective.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Speaking**
I've done more than handful for talks until this year, but I've never had one away from home (not in Israel).
On June, it was my first time speaking aboard. It was a very refreshing experience and hopefully I will have more chances in the future.

The talk was related to my research on the future of Smart Contracts using WebAssembly for spacemesh.
talk-link: TBD
<br/>
<br/>
### **Blogging**
Starting my new blog was something I really wanted do that for a long time, and I'm really happy I've taken this step.
I wish myself that I'll be able to be persistent and publish occasionally articles people will find useful.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Summary**
I feel that reinvented myself in many ways this year. The last time I've felt that was when around 5 years ago when
transforming from a .NET developer (Windows and Visual Studio of course) to a Mac user, programming in Ruby using vim.

Learning is a life-long unbounded journey.
<br/>
I have in my mind where I'd like to move forward in 2020.
Hopefully, I will be fulfill at least half of my ambitions.
