The end of 2019 is right near the corner, and I thought it would be the right time for me to reflect over my professional progress over the last year,
and write a post about it.

### **New Job**

Somewhere at 2015, I've read about a relatively new programming-language called Rust developed in Mozilla.
From a first glance, the syntax was a bit awkward and I've chosen not to pursue with researching it.

It wasn't until 2018 that it finally struck me that Rust is not just another new trendy programming-language, but something different, disruptive that must be learned.
I finally understood what the hype was all about. And I really wanted to work with this programming-language sometime.
<br/>

In December 2018, after I've left my previous job after working for more than 4 years as a Ruby developer on a social platform,
I was looking for a position that will enforce me to get out of my comfort zone and push me to my limits.
<br/>

I really wanted that position to involve programming in Rust to some extent. Since the language has been (and still is) in its early-adopters stage,
there weren't not many vacancies, let alone in Israel which is a small country. Therefore, I've looked for a Rust remote position.

Unsurprisingly, there weren't many remote options either, but luckily I've stumbled upon a small remote jobs website that had an open position in NYC.
The name of the company was [spacemesh][spacemesh], where I'm working now. The funny thing is that spacemesh is an Israeli company that looked for people outside of Israel too.
spacemesh is about TBD

Besides only knowing the very basics of Rust and having no hands-on Rust experience, this position was about developing Smart-Contracts infrastructure.
Meaning, having some compilation knowledge was also required. Besides, doing a Compilers course more than 10 years ago I didn't have any knowledge whatsoever.
Actually, I had no knowledge about Blockchain or Smart-Contracts either.

<br/>
Obviously, this position seemed like one that will demand me to go out of my comfort zone and return in many terms to be a Rookie, and that was perfect for me.
Luckily, I got the chance and got this position!
<br/>
I was ready to embark on this new journey, with much excitement and some fears how things will turn.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Rust**

So 2019 was the year I started working as a Rust programmer. Rust is known for having a steep learning curve but in the end of the day it's worth it.
These days Rust is heavily used in Blockchain projects. New databases are being written in it. Games companies start using it and many deep-tech companies
have Rust as part of their tech-stack.

Not only that, but whale companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dropbox and more are betting on Rust. It's seems like a new era.
I think that the turning point for many Rust users is that historically TBD
<br/>
<br/>
### **Compilation**

As part of my job, I've immersed myself in the fascinating world of compilers in general and specifically WebAssembly.
I still have a long way to go in these, but I did manage to build a very basic programming-language that runs in interpreted mode.
Here is a link to the repository.

In the last months of this year I've reached the first milestone of SVM - the runtime based on wasmer that spacemesh will execute in the future
its Smart-Contracts. More on SVM can be read here TBD
<br/>
<br/>
### **Relearning to type**

I've written about Relearning to type in this post. Besides the obvious productivity boost of using a more ergonomic keyboard-layout, there is the mental side
of muscle memory re-wiring. Taking this challenge was not easy but very rewarding. I'd recommend anyone to try out sometime to try this or something else similar
that will make them relearn a daily activity that are doing in an autopilot mode.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Reading code**

I've always loved reading beautiful pieces of code. Learning how other people think, how they approach a given problem.
Observing elegant abstractions that simplify otherwise problems that seems intractable.
This year I've read a lot of Open-Source code. This is undoubtedly something I'd like to continue doing and at greater scale in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Working on my English**

This year I've worked hard on my English vocabulary, hoping that having a richer dictionary will give me a boost while working.
It might sounds weird for you, but actually I do think that it helped me so far.

First of all, a considerable amount of development-time is communicating what we did/doing/will be doing.
We write emails, Slack with other people, write comments on PRs and of course we document our code.
Being able to deliver you message is critical.
<br/>
Secondly, there's a well known quote saying:
<br/>
_There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things_
_- Phil Karlton_
<br/>
Naming things right is crucial to writing good code. A good code should be explicit and express its intent clearly.
Without good names for functions/classes/modules/variables the readability of the code will suffer.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Speaking**

I've done more than handful for talks until today, but never done one away from home (not in Israel).
On June, it was my first time speaking aboard. It was a very refreshing experience and I will have more chances in the future.
The talk was related to my research on the future of Smart Contracts using WebAssembly for spacemesh.
talk-link: TBD
<br/>
<br/>
### **Blogging**

Starting my new blog this year was a very important thing for me. I wanted to do that for a lot of time, and I'm really happy
I've done this step. I wish myself that I'll be able to be persistent and publish occasionally articles people will find useful.
<br/>
<br/>
### **Other**
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the professional stuff outlined in this post I've played a lot of chess games online.
I'm not a good chess player and actually I don't really target to be one.
<br/>
Besides the fun of playing chess, I've found that it helps me stay in focus.
Since each chess games is unique, I encounter boards layouts I've seen before and it requires me to think fast in new ways.

Lastly, this year I didn't do enough Sports as I hoped.
However, I've read that rope-jumping is one of the most effective aerobic exercises.
I've started doing rope-jumping workouts and I must say it was surprisingly fun. It also exhausts me way faster that running.
