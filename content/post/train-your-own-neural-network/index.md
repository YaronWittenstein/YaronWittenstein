These days applying Machine Learning and particularly Deep-Learning solutions are mentioned all over the place.
Many problems are tackled by modeling Neural-Networks, feeding them with tons of data and consequently they "learn" 
and turn artificially "smarter". Thanks to the progress of ...


Humans can't read a million books over the course of our lifetime. 
<br/>
Neither can we manually code a billion lines of code, speak fluently 100 different languages or paint million drawings. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, we are still able to accomplish a lot. Much more than we think we can. 
<br/>

There is the classic saying that _"Practice makes Perfect"_. 
<br/>This is partly true, but it's also that _"Practice also makes you Permanent"_.
... deliberate practice rears it head. But there are manifold ways to practice deliberately. 
<br/><br/>
I'd like this article to focus on what I would call _"Train Your Own Netural Technique"_ technique. Let's use the _TYONT_ for short for the rest of the post. 
The essence of _TYONT_ is making feeding your brain with tons of data relevant that you care about.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd divide that into 2 categories: Factual and Pattern-Oriented.
<br/>
_Factual_ data that we care about may be general data or domain/profession specific data.
<br/><br/>

### General factual data:
Examples for general data are:

* Historical - When did the French revolution took place? Who was the president of the United-States during World War II?  

* Wisdom Quotes - Remembering inspiring [quotes of Winston Churchill][churchill-quotes] such as 
_"Success is never found. Failure is never fatal. Courage is the only thing."_ 

* Jokes - If you want to be the most funny guy in the room, you'd better own an arsenal of Jokes for almost any situation.

* Vocabulary - Want to save time looking for the right word composing an email? Make sure you work on your vocabulary. 
(there are many other advantages for having a broad vocabulary).
<br/><br/>

### Domain-specific factual data:
Since I'm a developer and this blog assumes its readers are too, I'll use programming factual data here but you could easily see how it translates 
to other professions.

* Shortcuts - How do I re-open Chrome's last closed Tab? 

* Commands - How do I discard the local git uncommitted changes via the command-line?

* Syntax / Libraries - How do I create a new module in that language?
What's the 2nd parameter this common-library's function signature expects?
<br/>
<br/>

### Patterns:
Now, let's move on and talk about the more interesting category: Patterns.
As opposed to factual data which is well-defined, patterns aren't.
<br/>
When I'm refering to a _Pattern_ here, I refer to a core solution technique which is relevant to a wide class of inputs problems.
If there is a problem with a unique (or rare) solution that isn't relevant to other similar problems then I'd not consider it as a Pattern.
<br/>
Even though, there is not a well-defined algorithm that given a problem's solution could say whether it's a common pattern or not,
I'd still try my best to claim there is such a category.
<br/>
So instead of writing: "Problems having common solutions that can be reused in many places." I'd stick with the term a Pattern.
<br/>
I'm also aware that something one would consider a pattern wouldn't be regarded as such by another person. That's totaly fine.
What's important is that anyone will be able to execute its own classification and decide if he/she considers something as a pattern.
<br/>

So since it's individual, I'd give things I view as patterns:
* Math - Prove that the root of 2 is a irrational number.
<br/>
The classic solution is to the above is prove by contradiction.
I see it as a pattern since I can imagine many problems that would require me to use the solution.
Maybe I'll need to prove that root of 5 isn't a rational number of perhaps use that root of 2 isn't a rational in the context
of a Geometry problem. Anyhow, I'd categorize it as a pattern.

* Chess - Given a board position, see how you can do matt in 2 moves.
If the solution to a given a chess challenge it to sacrifice a chess item in order to win, I'd call it a pattern since there are for sure
many similar board positions that will require me to sacrifice an item in order to make a progress/win/avoid immediate lose.

* Programming - How you'd implement a Linked-List in C? 
<!-- Maybe I don't need to implement a linked-list on my next task, but being able to delete an item from a Linked-List can strengthen the  -->
<!-- the importance of checking edge-cases. Deleting a emi -->


Our brain is very good at recognizing patterns. It can in a fraction of a second view an image and detect objects. 
When it encounters a life-situation, it immediately loads memories from other past situations that have resemblence the current one.
Sometimes our brain finds connections between things that seem unrelated and it takes us some time to figure out why it chose to. 
The more we'll train our brains the better our toolbox will be expanded. It means we can solve not only more problems but also in more elegantly
since we'll have more ways to approach them.
