These days applying Machine Learning and particularly Deep-Learning solutions are mentioned all over the place.
Many problems are tackled by modeling Neural-Networks, feeding them with tons of data and consequently they "learn" 
and turn artificially "smarter". Thanks to the progress of ...


It's true that us, humans can't read a million books over the course of our lifetime. 
<br/>
Neither can we manually code a billion lines of code, speak fluently 100 different languages or paint million drawings. 
<br/>
However, we are still able to accomplish a lot. Much more than think we can. 
<br/>

There is the classic saying that _"Practice makes Perfect"_. This is partly true, but it's also that _"Practice also makes you Permanent"_.
... deliberate practice rears it head. But there are manifold ways to practice deliberately. 
</br>
I'd like this article to focus on what I would call __Train Your Own Netural Technique"_ technique. Let's use the _TYONT_ for short for the rest of the post. 
The essence of _TYONT_ is making feeding your brain with tons of data relevant that you care about.
I'd divide that into 2 categories: Factual and Pattern-Oriented.
</br>
_Factual_ data that we care about may be general data or domain/profession specific data.
</br>

## General factual data:
Examples for general data are:
* Historical - When did the French revolution took place? Who was the president of the United-States during World War II?  
* Wisdom Quotes - Remebering inspiring [quotes of Winston Churchill][churchill-quotes] such as 
_"â€œSuccess is never found. Failure is never fatal. Courage is the only thing."_ 
* Jokes - If you want to be the most funny guy in the room, you'd better own an arsenal of Jokes for almost any situation.
* Vocabulary - Want to save time looking for the right word composing an email? Make sure you work on your vocabulary. 
(there are many other advantages for having a broad vocabulary).


### Domain specific factual data:
<br/>
Since I'm a developer and this blog assumes its readers are too, I'll use Programming factual data here but you could easily see how it translates 
to other professions.

* Shortcuts - How do I re-open Chrome's last closed Tab? 
* Commands - How do I discard the local git uncommitted changes via the command-line?
* Syntax / Libraries - How do I create a new module in that language?
What's the 2nd parameter this common-library's function signature expects?
