These days applying Machine Learning and particularly Deep-Learning techiques in order to implement technical challenges are mentioned all over the place.
Many problems are tackled by modeling Neural-Networks, feeding them with tons of data and consequently they "learn" 
and turn artificially "smarter". Thanks to the progress of TBD

We, Humans, have an inferior processing speed of information.
<br/>
We can't read a million books over the course of our lifetime. 
<br/>
Neither can we manually code a billion lines of code, 
<br/>
speak fluently 100 different languages or paint million drawings. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, we are still able to accomplish quite a lot.
<br/>
Much more than we think we can. 
<br/>

There is the classic saying that _"Practice makes Perfect"_. 
<br/>This is partly true, because it's also that _"Practice also makes you Permanent"_.
<br/>
... deliberate practice rears it head. But there are manifold ways to practice deliberately. 
<br/><br/>
I'd like this article to focus on what I would call _"Train Your Own Netural Technique"_ technique. Let's use the _TYONT_ for short for the rest of the post. 
The essence of _TYONT_ is feeding your brain with tons of data relevant to things you care about.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm dividing that data into 2 categories: Factual and Pattern-Oriented.
<br/>
<br/>
First the _Factual data_ that we care about - it may be general or domain/profession specific data.
<br/><br/>

### General factual data:
This is straightforward - pieces of data that are mere facts.
#### Examples:

* Historical 
<br/>
When did the French revolution took place?
<br/>
Who was the president of the United-States during World War II?  

* Wisdom Quotes 
<br/>
Remembering inspiring [quotes of Winston Churchill][churchill-quotes] such as 
<br/>
_"Success is never found. Failure is never fatal. Courage is the only thing."_ 

* Jokes 
<br/>
If you want to be the most funny guy in the room, you'd better own an arsenal of Jokes for almost any situation.

* Vocabulary 
<br/>
What's the meaning of TBD

<br/>
### Domain-specific factual data:
Since I'm a developer and this blog assumes its readers are too, I'll use programming factual data here but you could easily see how it translates 
to other professions.

* Shortcuts 
<br/>
How do I re-open Chrome's last closed Tab? 

* Commands 
<br/>
How do I discard the local git uncommitted changes via the command-line?

* Syntax / Libraries 
<br/>
How do I create a new module in that language?
<br/>
What's the 2nd parameter this common-library's function signature expects?
<br/>
<br/>

### Patterns:
Now, let's move on and talk about the more interesting category: Patterns.
As opposed to factual data which is well-defined, patterns aren't.
<br/>
When I'm refering to a _Pattern_ here, I refer to a core solution-technique which is relevant to a wide class of problems.
<br/>
If there is a problem with a unique (or rare) solution that isn't applicable to other similar - then I'd NOT consider it as a Pattern.
<br/>
<br/>
Although there is not a well-defined algorithm that given a challenge, could say if its solutions consist of common techniques or not - 
I'd still try my best to argue there is place for having that category. Please bear with me. 
<br/>
<br/>
So instead of writing: _"Challenges having common solutions that can be reused in many places"_ - I'd stick with the term a _Pattern_.
<br/>
I'm also aware that what one would consider a technique as a _Pattern_, another person wouldn't - and that's totaly fine.
<br/>
<br/>
What's important is that anyone will be able to execute his own classification and decide if he views it as a _Pattern_.
<br/>

Since it's an individual discernment - I'd like to give examples of stuff I'd call _Patterns_:

* Math  
<br/>
Prove that the root of 2 is a irrational number.
<br/>
<br/>
Why a _Pattern_? The classic solution is to the above is prove by contradiction.
I see it as a pattern since I can imagine many problems that would require me to use the solution.
Maybe I'll need to prove that root of 5 isn't a rational number of perhaps use that root of 2 isn't a rational in the context
of a Geometry problem. 

* Chess 
<br/>
Given the following board position - how can do matt in 2 moves?
<br/>
<br/>
Why a _Pattern_? The solution to the above is to sacrifice a chess item in order to win, I'd call it a pattern since there are 
endless similar board positions that will require me to sacrifice an item in order to make a progress/win/avoid immediate lose.

* Programming - How you'd implement a Linked-List in C? 
<!-- Maybe I don't need to implement a linked-list on my next task, but being able to delete an item from a Linked-List can strengthen the  -->
<!-- the importance of checking edge-cases. Deleting a emi -->

<br/>
Our brain is very good at recognizing patterns. It can in a fraction of a second view an image and detect objects. 
When it encounters a life-situation, it immediately loads memories from other past situations that have resemblence the current one.
Sometimes our brain finds connections between things that seem unrelated and it takes us some time to figure out why it chose to. 
The more we'll train our brains the better our toolbox will be expanded. It means we can solve not only more problems but also in more elegantly
since we'll have more ways to approach them.
