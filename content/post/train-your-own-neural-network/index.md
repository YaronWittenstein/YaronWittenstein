These days applying Machine Learning and particularly Deep-Learning solutions are mentioned all over the place.
Many problems are tackled by modeling Neural-Networks, feeding them with tons of data and consequently they "learn" 
and turn artificially "smarter". Thanks to the progress of ...


It's true that us, humans can't read a million books over the course of our lifetime. 
<br/>
Neither can we manually code a billion lines of code, speak fluently 100 different languages or paint million drawings. 
<br/>
However, we are still able to accomplish a lot. Much more than think we can. 
<br/>

There is the classic saying that _"Practice makes Perfect"_. This is partly true, but it's also that _"Practice also makes you Permanent"_.
... deliberate practice rears it head. But there are manifold ways to practice deliberately. 
</br>
I'd like this article to focus on what I would call __Train Your Own Netural Technique"_ technique. Let's use the _TYONT_ for short for the rest of the post. 
The essence of _TYONT_ is making feeding your brain with tons of data relevant that you care about.
I'd divide that into 2 categories: Factual and Pattern-Oriented.

_Factual_ data may
