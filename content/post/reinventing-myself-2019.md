The end of 2019 is right near the corner, and I thought it would be the right time for me to reflect over my professional progress over the last year,
and write a post about it.

### **New Job**

In December 2018, after I've left my previous job after working for more than 4 years as a Ruby developer on a social platform,
I was looking for a position that will enforce me to get out of my comfort zone and push me to my limits.
<br/>
Somewhere at 2015, I've read about a relatively new programming-language called Rust developed in Mozilla.
From a first glance, the syntax was a bit awkward and I've chosen not to pursue with researching it.

It wasn't until 2018 that it finally struck me that Rust is not just another new trendy programming-language, but something different, disruptive that must be learned.
I finally understood what the hype was all about. And I really wanted to work with this programming-language sometime.

So when I was seeking a new job my first priority was to a full-time Rust position. Since the language has been (and still is) in its early-adopters stage,
there weren't not many vacancies, let alone in Israel which is a small country. Therefore, I've looked for a Rust remote position.

Unsurprisingly, there weren't many remote options either, but luckily I've stumbled upon a small remote jobs website that had an open position in NYC.
The name of the company was [spacemesh][spacemesh], where I work now. The funny thing is that spacemesh is an Israeli company that looked for people outside of Israel too.
spacemesh is about...

Besides only knowing the very basics with Rust and having no hands-on Rust experience, this position was for developing Smart-Contracts infrastructure.
So having some compilation knowledge was was also required. Besides, doing a Compilers course more than 10 years ago I didn't have any knowledge whatsoever.
Actually, I had no knowledge about Blockchain or Smart-Contracts.

<br/>
Obviously, this position seemed like one that will demand me to go out of my comfort zone and be in many terms a Rookie - that was perfect for me.
Luckily for me I got the chance and got this position!
<br/>
I was ready to embark on this new journey, with much excitement and some fears how things will turn.
