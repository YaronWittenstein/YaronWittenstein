The end of 2019 is right near the corner, and I thought it would be the right time for me to reflect over my professional progress over the last year,
and write a post about it.

### **Rust**
In December 2018, I've started a new job at a company called [spacemesh][spacemesh]. spacemesh is about...
After working for more than 4 years as a Ruby developer on a social platform, I was looking for a position that will enforce me to get out of
my comfort zone and push me to my limits.
<br/>
Somewhere at 2015, I've read about a relatively new programming-language called Rust developed in Mozilla.
From a first glance, the syntax was a bit awkward and I've chosen not to pursue with researching it.

Fast-forward to the end of 2016, I've watched [this introduction talk][rust-intro-talk] about Rust, but again didn't deepened my interest yet.
It wasn't until 2018 that I finally resolved that it's not just another new trendy programming-language, but something different, disruptive that must be learned.
I finally understood what the hype was all about. And I really wanted to work with this programming-language sometime.

So when I was seeking a new job my first priority was to be a full-time Rust position. Since it's been (and still is) in the early-adopters stage, there weren't not many
vacancies, and of course not in Israel which is a small country. Therefore, I've searched for a Rust remote position.

Unsurprisingly, there weren't many remote options too, but luckily I've stumbled upon a small remote jobs website that had an open position in NYC.
The name of the company was spacemesh, where I work now. The funny thing is that spacemesh is an Israeli company that looked for people outside of Israel too.
