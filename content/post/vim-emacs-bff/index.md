The year was 1976.
<br/>The two most gigantic text-editors the universe has ever known sprang into existence.
Subsequently, one of history's most ruthless wars has started.

On one side stood vi (succeeded later by vim) -</br> a small and agile text-editor based on modal-editing.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of the battlefield stood emacs -</br> a tall and stout operating-system having a feeble text-editor (some argue it had no text-editor at all...). 

Who will ascend the throne and be the best text-editor has ever lived?

The years have passed, and new wanna-be text-editors rivals were born.
<br/>
A partial list contain names you may have heard of such as: SublimeText, Atom, VSCode and IntelliJ.

They tried everything to get some traction, but vim and emacs stayed in a league of their own.
Desperately, they started mimicing elements of these two, without much success.

vim and emacs started to accept they are both here to stay and that no one will be pronounced a winner. 
Hatred has slowly (but steadily) declined and been substituted with mutual-respect.
Each party recognized the strengths of the other. 

Although there are no public surviving evidences today, the two started to like each other.
It was all a matter of time until some official collaboration will occur.
