The year was 1976.
<br/>The two most gigantic text-editors the universe has ever known sprang into existence.
Subsequently, one of history's most ruthless wars has started.

On one side stood vi (succeeded later by vim) - a small and agile text-editor based on modal-editing.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of the battlefield stood emacs - a tall and stout operating-system having a feeble text-editor (some argue it had no text-editor at all...). 

Who will ascend the throne and be the best text-editor has ever lived?

The years have passed, and new wanna-be text-editors rivals were born.
<br/>
A partial list contain names you may have heard of such as: SublimeText, Atom, VSCode and IntelliJ.

They tried everything to get some traction, but vim and emacs stayed in a league of their own.
Desperately, they started mimicing elements of these two, without much success.
