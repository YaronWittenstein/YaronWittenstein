Hi,
<br/>
I'm Yaron Wittenstein, a Software Developer located in Israel.

My main interests are:

* Programming Languages
* Software Architecture
* Productivity and Knowledge-Management

I work at [spacemesh][spacemesh] on the Smart-Contracts infrastructure.<br/>
And I code mostly in Rust (and a bit of Golang and C)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on the [svm][svm] project.

If you'd like to contact me,
<br/>
please email me at **yaron.wittenstein@gmail.com**
